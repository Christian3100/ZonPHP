# ZonPHP
##PHP Solar Logger

base on the version from slaper (http://www.slaper.be) and Rally (http://www.rallyhammer.be/RallyForum) 
I decided to build an new version without Adobe FLASH so it can be uses 
on mobile and tablets as well.

So I replaced all charts with a new JavaScript charts using http://www.highcharts.com/ 
and refactored the PHP code.

The new version is highly configurable and extendable.

In version 2017.01.12.01 I also integrated weatherstations using weewx (http://weewx.com/)
so now you can integrate weather data into you solar charts.

If you have any feedback or questions, please contact me at <solar@seehausen.org>
